description: "scafctl-plugin-static: Run Go code review on recent changes. Checks for idiomatic Go, security, error handling, concurrency, and scafctl-plugin-static conventions."
agent: "go-reviewer"
---
Review the current Go code thoroughly. You MUST complete ALL phases below. Do not stop after finding a few issues.

## Phase 1: Automated checks

1. Run `go vet ./...` and `task lint`
5. Run `go test -coverprofile` on **every** changed package
6. Run `go test -race` on changed packages

## Phase 2: Systematic review (check EVERY item)

For each changed/new file, check ALL of these categories. Do not skip any.

### Security
- [ ] Command injection (user input passed to exec without sanitization)
- [ ] Path traversal (user-controlled paths not validated for containment)
- [ ] Hardcoded secrets, tokens, or credentials
- [ ] Unsafe deserialization of untrusted input

### Error handling
- [ ] Ignored errors (unchecked error returns, `_ = someFunc()`)
- [ ] Missing error wrapping (`fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)`)
- [ ] Panics used for recoverable errors
- [ ] Error messages that leak sensitive information

### Concurrency
- [ ] Goroutine leaks (goroutines that never exit)
- [ ] Race conditions (shared state without synchronization)
- [ ] Deadlock potential (inconsistent lock ordering)

### Code quality
- [ ] Functions over 60 lines (flag, suggest extraction)
- [ ] Nesting depth over 4 levels
- [ ] Non-idiomatic Go patterns

### scafctl-plugin-static conventions
- [ ] Terminal output uses `writer.FromContext(ctx)` (never `fmt.Fprintf`)
- [ ] Structured data uses `kvx.OutputOptions`
- [ ] Struct tags: JSON, YAML, doc, validation present per conventions
- [ ] Business logic is NOT in CLI commands, MCP handlers, or API packages
- [ ] Binary name uses `settings.CliBinaryName` or `settings.Run.BinaryName`
- [ ] No magic values (use constants or settings)

### Schema and documentation consistency
- [ ] Input schemas match runtime validation
- [ ] Output schemas match actual return types for ALL capabilities/modes
- [ ] Description strings accurately reflect current behavior
- [ ] Examples in provider descriptors are correct after changes
- [ ] Example files, tutorials, and help text match actual code behavior (types, routes, defaults)

### Naming
- [ ] New public symbols follow Go conventions and project patterns
- [ ] Input/output field names are clear and unambiguous
- [ ] Names do not conflict with established ecosystem meaning
- [ ] Consistent naming with similar existing features
- [ ] Uses `cCmd.Name()` not `cCmd.Use` for programmatic command identification

### Correctness
- [ ] Delegation: when creating temporary structs to delegate, ALL fields used by the callee are forwarded (read the callee to verify)
- [ ] Mutation safety: no mutation of shared/input structs; prefer passing overrides
- [ ] Edge cases: nil inputs, empty slices, zero values handled
- [ ] Default values: verify defaults match documentation and schema
- [ ] Map iteration: output built from map ranges must sort keys for deterministic ordering
- [ ] State persistence: metadata only persisted after the operation it describes succeeds
- [ ] `defer cancel()` placed immediately after context creation, before any early returns

### Dead code
- [ ] New exported functions have callers outside test files (use `grep` to verify)
- [ ] New struct fields are read/written somewhere (use `grep` to verify)
- [ ] No orphaned imports after refactoring
- [ ] No unused config fields that imply unimplemented features

### Observability
- [ ] Metric labels use bounded cardinality (route patterns, not raw paths with IDs)
- [ ] Config/spec export functions thread runtime config (not hardcoded defaults)

## Phase 3: Adversarial analysis

For each new feature or behavioral change, actively try to break it:
- What happens with nil/empty/zero inputs?
- What happens if a dependency is missing or returns an error?
- What happens under concurrent access?
- What happens if the user provides conflicting flags (e.g., `--force` and `--on-conflict error`)?
- Can this change cause a regression in existing behavior?

## Phase 4: Cross-file consistency

- [ ] Changes to types/interfaces are reflected in all implementations
- [ ] Changes to function signatures are reflected in all call sites
- [ ] New context values have matching With*/FromContext pairs AND tests
- [ ] Provider schema changes are reflected in provider tests

## Phase 5: Coverage analysis

1. Run `go test -coverprofile=cover.out ./path/to/changed/pkg/...` for each changed package
2. Run `go tool cover -func=cover.out` to get per-function coverage
3. For **every** changed file:
   - Flag any changed function with coverage below 70%
   - Flag any NEW file with overall coverage below 70%
   - Flag any file with 0% patch coverage as **HIGH** severity
4. Estimate patch coverage: what percentage of the NEW/CHANGED lines in the diff are exercised by tests?
   - Target: 70%+ patch coverage overall
   - CLI command files (`pkg/cmd/`) must not drop below 65% package coverage
5. For each gap, recommend specific test cases (function name, inputs, expected behavior)

## Phase 6: Self-review (MANDATORY, do not skip)

After completing phases 1-5, review your own findings:
1. Re-read the full diff one more time
2. For each file you reviewed, ask: "What did I NOT check?"
3. For each finding you reported, ask: "Is this the root cause or just a symptom?"
4. Look for patterns: if you found one delegation bug, are there OTHER delegations with the same problem?
5. Check: did you verify every item in the Phase 2 checklist? If you skipped any, go back now.

Report any additional findings from the self-review as a separate section.

## Output format

Use severity levels: CRITICAL > HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW > INFO
For each finding include: file, line, severity, description, and suggested fix.
End with a summary table: files reviewed, findings by severity, coverage status.
